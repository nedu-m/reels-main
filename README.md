
# Reels Movie App

This is a movie app that uses the [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) to fetch movies and display them on the page.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## The idea behind the example

This example shows how to use Next.js along with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to build a simple blog.

## Deploy your own

Once you have access to the environment variables you'll need, deploy the example using [Vercel](https://vercel.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) ([Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)).

## Notes

- The `pages/api` directory is for Movie API routes. You can use this directory to create API routes for your movie app. Learn more about [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) in Next.js.
